## 1. Issue

**Title:**  
Subclassed SkyCoord gives misleading attribute access message  

**Short Description:**  
When subclassing `SkyCoord` and adding custom properties, an `AttributeError` for a non-existent internal attribute incorrectly reports the custom property as missing, rather than the internal attribute.

---

## 2. Knowledge Categories Relevant to This Case

### General Root Cause Analysis Steps
- **1.2** Trace the inheritance chain to locate where attribute resolution happens.  
- **1.3** Analyze object initialization flow to detect missing attribute injection points.  
- **1.5** Verify attribute access patterns across class hierarchy.

### Issue Categorization
- **2.1** Type: Attribute Initialization Bug in Class Inheritance.  
- **2.2** Scope: OOP design flaw affecting subclass property resolution.

### General Fix Pattern
- **3.1** Correct attribute initialization sequence to ensure parent attributes exist before property resolution.  
- **3.3** Preserve subclass extensibility while fixing core behavior.

### Summary of Fix Checklist
- **4.3** Check attribute propagation across inheritance chain.  
- **4.4** Validate property access in subclasses.

### Design Patterns & Coding Practices
- **5.1** Apply proper attribute initialization in `__new__` / `__init__`.  
- **5.2** Ensure Liskov Substitution Principle compliance for subclasses.

## 3. Workflow Steps Analysis

### 3.1 Fault Localization

| Tool Type        | Location Found | Knowledge Contribution |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Without Knowledge | Focused on `SkyCoord` subclass property definition only; did not inspect core resolution flow. | None — search scope restricted to symptom location. |
| With Knowledge | Traced through `SkyCoord → BaseCoordinateFrame → __getattr__` logic in `coordinates/sky_coordinate.py`, confirming where the misleading `AttributeError` originates. | **Knowledge 1.2** (inheritance chain tracing) and **Knowledge 1.5** (attribute access pattern verification) guided traversal into the resolution method rather than stopping at the property. |

**Effect:** With knowledge, the agent mapped the entire resolution path, not just the property in the subclass.

---

### 3.2 Root Cause Analysis

| Tool Type        | Root Cause Found | Knowledge Contribution |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Without Knowledge | `"Attribute lookup failure"` in property; concluded it’s a missing attribute in subclass. | None — lacked insight into how attribute errors are constructed upstream. |
| With Knowledge | Misleading error originates because `__getattr__` catches `AttributeError` from internal attribute lookup (`random_attr`) but re-raises it as if the property (`prop`) is missing. | **Knowledge 1.3** (object initialization flow analysis) + **Knowledge 2.1** (categorizing as attribute init bug in inheritance) enabled deeper cause tracing beyond symptom. |

**Effect:** With knowledge, the cause was linked to error propagation behavior, not just a missing field.

---

### 3.3 Mapper: Patch Planning

| Tool Type        | Patch Plan | Knowledge Contribution |
|------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Without Knowledge | Suggest adjust property to check existence before access. | None — patch is local to property. |
| With Knowledge | Modify `__getattr__` to preserve original `AttributeError` from internal lookup, ensuring the missing internal attribute name appears in the message. Maintain backward compatibility for existing error messages where possible. | **Knowledge 3.1** (fix init issues in chain), **Knowledge 3.3** (preserve extensibility), **Knowledge 5.1** (proper attr init) influenced minimal but precise fix location. |

---

### 3.4 Patch Generation & Verification

- **Without Knowledge:** Changes property definition to guard against missing attributes — symptom fix only.  
- **With Knowledge:** Adjusts `__getattr__` in `SkyCoord`’s base class so that `AttributeError` correctly reflects missing internal attributes.

**Verification Tests (With Knowledge)** — based on **Knowledge 4.3** & **4.4**:
1. Subclass with property referencing non-existent internal attribute should raise `AttributeError` for the missing internal name.  
2. Normal `SkyCoord` property access unaffected.  
3. Backward compatibility maintained for other error cases.

## 4. File View Trajectory Analysis

### With Knowledge
- **Operations:** 93  
  - 69 file refs  
  - 18 file views  
  - 6 directory views  
- **Focus:** Minimal, targeted — `coordinates/sky_coordinate.py`, attribute resolution code, relevant tests.

### Without Knowledge
- **Operations:** 269  
  - 207 file refs  
  - 38 file views  
  - 9 directory views  
  - 15 searches  
- **Focus:** Broad scanning, including unrelated subclass examples; no deep dive into attribute resolution.

## 5. Summary — Knowledge vs. No Knowledge

| Aspect            | Without Knowledge | With Knowledge |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Fault Localization | Stops at symptom in subclass property. | Traces full attribute resolution path using **Knowledge 1.2**, **1.5**. |
| Root Cause | Concludes property is broken. | Finds misleading error handling using **Knowledge 1.3**, **2.1**. |
| Patch Planning | Local defensive code in property. | Targeted fix in base class using **Knowledge 3.1**, **3.3**, **5.1**. |
| Verification | Unclear or minimal tests. | Multi-scenario tests ensuring fix correctness and compatibility using **Knowledge 4.3**, **4.4**. |
| Search Efficiency | 269 ops, scattered. | 93 ops, targeted. |

**Overall:**  
Knowledge enabled a precise architectural fix with fewer exploratory steps and better test coverage.
